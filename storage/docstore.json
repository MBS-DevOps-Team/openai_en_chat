Academic integrity refers to the existence of a \nrelationship based on honesty between the professor and his students. He \nconveys information to his students with all credibility and in all possible ways  \nuntil he is sure of their understanding and comprehension of it, and then  \ntrains them on how to measure and evaluate it until the main goal of the  \neducational process is achieved. It is building a balanced personality su itable   \nfor bearing the name of the prestigious Ain Shams University. The means and  \nmethods of measurement and evaluation and the university examination  \nprocess are the last gate that the student must cross in order to finally reach \nthe labor market. Therefore, the administration of Ain Shams University sees  \nthe necessity of verifying all components of academic integrity to achieve that \ngoal. Academic integrity consists of five values : \n\u2022 Honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility. All of these values \ncome together to form clear behavioral principles that contribute to  \nachieving the desired image of Ain Shams University and work to raise its  \nstatus. Academic integrity is of great importance not only to higher  \nto the entire community, as it affects the education institutions, but also  \ncommunity\u2019s vision of Ain Shams University, its perception of the level of  \nthe university\u2019s graduates, the psychological and moral structure, and the  \nvalue system of students as tomorrow\u2019s leaders.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b066cc6-99f5-4782-90f1-8388c194a48f": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b066cc6-99f5-4782-90f1-8388c194a48f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "107", "file_name": "Modified_Manula_En.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "af0ef58c-b217-488d-99c1-dffad171735c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "107", "file_name": "Modified_Manula_En.pdf"}, "hash": "4b1be825a2190010013e6625b24771d2bbe2b455c22bfd4fb5368141bece8c38"}}, "hash": "bc6ed46836e208d9fb30dcabb55e6268a7e847c2f2c00aca83ea3dc8aeee41e3", "text": "107 | P a g e \n Ain Shams University urges all its employees in general and those responsible  \nfor the educational process in particular to adhere to the highest standards \nof academic integrity.
